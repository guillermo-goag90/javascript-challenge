## Project Title
The purpose of this web application is to leverage a UFO sightings dataset and provide an interactive UI where users can filter UFO recorded observations by date.

The UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. A JavaScript script appends records the user's input (date) and filters the database to retrieve relevant results -UFO sightings within a date window. To display results, D3 is used to bind data to a Document Object Model and apply data-driven transformations to the document. Particularly, this script leverages D3 to generate an HTML table and then dinamically adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
