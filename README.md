## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation - ALIENS-R-REAL
The purpose of this web application is to leverage a UFO sightings dataset and provide an interactive UI where users can filter UFO recorded observations by date.

###### Automatic Table and Date Search
The UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. A JavaScript script appends records the user's input (date) and filters the database to retrieve relevant results -UFO sightings within a date window. To display results, D3 is used to bind data to a Document Object Model and apply data-driven transformations to the document. Particularly, this script leverages D3 to generate an HTML table and then dynamically updates and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 

###### Context
This project is developed as part of the University of Pennsylvania Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp.
